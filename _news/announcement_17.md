While we are migrating our website, we have a few good news that has happened in the past half a year: Edward Kim paper on approximate POMDP solving without numerical optimisation has been accepted to IJCAI ; Jingyang You paper on primitives for Inspection Planning using implicit models has been accepted to IROS ; Jonathon Schwartz and Rhys Newburry (Monash) paper on POSGGym --a software to ease integration of planning and learning in multi-agent systems-- has been accepted to JAAMAS. Congratulations Edward, Jingyang, Jonathon and Rhys!
